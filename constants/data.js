    description: [
      `I am a dedicated software developer with a background in mathematics, and recently completed a Computer Science degree at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. I am proficient in programming languages including Python, Java, C, and Go.`,
      `My professional experience includes a software engineering internship at Shipt, where I developed Go web services for ACH payment processing, implemented secure API integrations with financial institutions, and built event-driven architecture using Kafka and webhooks. I also work as a software developer at DarkTower, maintaining analytical tools and web scrapers, managing PostgreSQL databases, and enhancing our React-based website.`
      `As a recent Computer Science graduate from UAB, I served as a Teaching Assistant for Algorithms and Data Structures, Computer Organization and Assembly Language, and Systems Programming, where I conducted weekly labs, provided individual tutoring, and helped students with problem-solving and debugging. During my studies, I was actively involved in the tech community as president of the Association of Computing Machinery and a member of Women in Tech.`,
      `I continue to stay engaged with Birmingham's tech community through regular AI meetups. Having completed my degree and gained hands-on experience in financial technology and full-stack development, I'm excited to contribute my skills to innovative software solutions at a forward-thinking company.`,
